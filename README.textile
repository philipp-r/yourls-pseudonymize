h1. YOURLS Pseudonymize Plugin

This plugin "pseudonymizes" the IP addresses so that it is in line with the German privacy laws.

This effectively means, that the last 2 segments of an IP address are changed into a 0 ("zero"), thus removed.

*IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.*

*NOTE*: Requires PHP >= 5.2.0 due to "filter_var":http://php.net/manual/en/function.filter-var.php usage.
